# Modeling face memory reveals task-generalizable representations 
Jiayu Zhan, Oliver G. B. Garrod, Nicola van Rijsbergen and Philippe G. Schyns 

#### Mental representation has to be:
+ Accurate enough - identifying a face among other faces
+ Versatile enough - identifying a face in different angles, ages etc


modeled 3-dim representational contents of 4 faces
+ Created by reverse-correlating identity information
+ Validated using generalized identity judgements - change in viewpoints, age, sex
+ Modeled identity information in a face space that belongs to the broad class of 3D morphable active appearance models (AAMs) of facial synthesis - these models contain full 3D surface and 2D texture info about faces
